The city of Copenhagen consistently ranks highly in international surveys of quality of life, sustainability, happiness, and overall livability. Some of the factors that contribute to Copenhagen's livability include its extensive cycling infrastructure, excellent public transportation system and all the green spaces, with many parks and gardens scattered throughout the urban landscape. Urban planner and architect [Jan Gehl][Gehl] praises Copenhagen's city plan for its emphasis on walking and cycling: 
<br>
#### *"The city plan for Copenhagen invites people to walk and cycle as much as possible in the course of their daily life. That is good for the climate, it’s good for the noise in the city, it’s good for the pollution in the city, good for the energy consumption, and it’s good for your health."*

# Unveiling Copenhagen's Road User Mix: Who Rules the Streets?
While Copenhagen's emphasis on cycling and walking has undoubtedly contributed to its high livability ranking, it's important to understand the impact of these modes of transportation on traffic in the city. That's where traffic counts come in. By collecting data on the number of vehicles, pedestrians, and cyclists using specific roads and intersections, we can gain valuable insights into traffic patterns and identify areas where improvements may be needed. The most recent traffic counts in Copenhagen reveal some interesting trends. Out of 296 counting spots across Copenhagen, only 44 spots have more bicycles than cars. These spots are mainly located in the city center and in the district Nørrebro. [In 2009 it was decided to close large parts of Nørrebrogade for cars][NB], which might explain the relatively large amount of bike-dominated spots. Upon closer inspection of the traffic count data, it becomes clear that the label of "bicycle metropolis" may be a slight exaggeration. You can explore the traffic count data for your neighborhood in the map below.

# Exploring Traffic Safety and Pollution in Copenhagen
The traffic count data also revealed lots of car traffic on H.C. Andersens Boulevard, which is the most polluted road in Copenhagen. According to IQAir, air pollution is responsible for an estimated [550 premature deaths in Copenhagen each year][Air]. This is a sobering reminder that while Copenhagen may be a model of sustainable transportation, it still has work to do when it comes to protecting the health of its residents. The primary culprits for air pollution in Copenhagen are traffic and industry, with vehicles being the biggest contributor to harmful emissions. The EU has set [legally binding limits][EU] on air pollutant concentrations in ambient air, including NO2, SO2, and NOx. While Copenhagen has met acceptable levels for NO2 and SO2, it is still struggling to reach the goal for NOx. To address this, the Copenhagen Municipality has budgeted 149 million DKK to lower NOx levels, including investing in cleaner buses and other measures. These actions highlight the significance of city data in guiding effective urban planning strategies! Check out the air pollution graph, which shows the EU upper bounds marked with dotted vertical lines, to see the progress that the city is making towards reducing harmful air pollutants.

Motivated to hop on your bike? Proceed with caution! It's important to be aware of the potential risks in traffic. While cyclists tend to experience the highest number of minor and serious injuries year after year, it's worth noting that pedestrians used to the victims of the majority of traffic-related fatalities. However, the tragic reality has now shifted, with cyclists also accounting for a significant number of fatalities. The plot below provides detailed data on this distribution. To provide further context, it's worth mentioning that in 2022, [43 people lost their lives due to manslaughter][drab] throughout all of Denmark, a considerably lower number than the count of serious injuries in Copenhagen alone. Stay vigilant and prioritize your safety while cycling in traffic.
